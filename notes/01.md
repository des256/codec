# Introduction

Build a modern video codec and do some interesting research on it.
Hands-on engineering approach.
Some NIH.
Being able to measure compression and performance.
Being able to play around with parameters.
Make it understandable for everyone.
Maybe put on youtube.
And of course we use Rust.

# Focus

## Pixel Format

Only/first 420.

## Resolutions

Any resolution, first only multiples of the macroblocks. Deal with spillovers later.

## Frames

Only/first I-frames and P-frames. B-frames or others maybe later.

## Fields

No fields.

## Quantization

Use fixed matrix. Later try out other possibilities.

## DCT/IDCT

Both 4x4 and 8x8 variants used.

## Fractal Encoding

Take some giant power-of-two block, split into 4 equal squares. Recurse over those squares, until block is 4x4. Pass back analysis of encoding to previous step, decide there if residuals or motion vectors need to appear or can be encoded at lower fidelity.

## Arithmetic Coding

Ignored. Just use a byte stream. Any entropy coding comes later.

## Macroblock Encoding

For each channel, encode prediction, followed by residuals.

## I-frame Predictions

1. None, everything comes from residual encoding.
2. H264-like, extract from neighboring pixels.
3. From autoencoder.

## P-frame Predictions

1. Fractal-encoded motion vectors.
2. From autoencoder.

Only predict from direct previous frame.

# Debug Tool

Work roughly like the H264 analyzer.
Built with Flutter.
Using FFI to Rust.

## UX

Frames:
    Timeline
Blocks:
    Prediction
    Motion Vectors
    Residuals
    Quantization
Stream:
    Bytes
    Binary
